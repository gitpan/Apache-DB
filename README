DESCRIPTION
    Perl ships with a very useful interactive debugger, however, it
    does not run "out-of-the-box" in the Apache/mod_perl
    environment. Apache::DB makes a few adjustments so the two will
    cooperate.

CAVEATS
    -X  The server must be started with the `-X' to use Apache::DB.

    preloading
        Module and scripts that are compiled during server startup
        time will not have debugging hooks enabled.
