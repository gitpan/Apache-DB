This package provides debugging and profiling tools for mod_perl:

 Apache::DB        - Hooks for the interactive Perl debugger
 Apache::DProf     - Hooks for Devel::DProf
 Apache::SmallProf - Hooks for Devel::SmallProf

These modules are very useful for helping to determine the cause of
errors and performance problems in mod_perl applications. They should
function with both mod_perl 1.x and 2.x. 

These modules were originally written by Doug MacEachern. 

They are currently being maintained by Frank Wiles <frank@wiles.org>. 
Please E-mail him with any bugs you may find.
